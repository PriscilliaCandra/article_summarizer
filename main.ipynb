      "The new recommendations fulfill Kennedy’s promise that they will run only a few pages. Officials say that following the guidance “can help prevent the onset or slow the rate of progression of chronic disease” The latest update includes images of an inverted pyramid that puts meats, cheese and vegetables in the widest part at the top. The 2025-30 dietary guidelines focus on more protein intake than has previously been recommended. The new recommendation is based on body weight: 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram per day. The guidelines also recommend three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits per day for a typical 2,000-calorie diet. 79% of school meal program directors say they need more funding to reduce reliance on ultraprocessed foods. The American Heart Association calls for Congress to increase funding for school meal programs. The new guidelines may take years to affect school meals. The US Department of Agriculture must first turn the updated guidelines into breakfast and lunch standards. Every five years, HHS and the USDA update the federal dietary guidelines based on the latest research. The guidelines are often used by medical professionals and policymakers to help determine what students eat in schools, what doctors recommend to their patients and what people can buy with food stamps. Kennedy has criticized the development process and promised a vastly shortened set of recommendations to emphasize whole foods. Willett: I fear a rerun of the CDC vaccine review committee process. “None of this is happening” under the Trump administration’s process, he says. Willett: The 2025 US Dietary Guidelines scientific advisory committee was carefully selected based on extensive experience and knowledge across many relevant areas.\n"
